Today, I dived into the world of form validation, enhancing user interactions with a powerful validation system. Here's what I accomplished:

✅ Field Validation: I implemented validation checks for various form fields, ensuring that user inputs meet specific criteria.

🚦 Real-Time Feedback: I provided users with instant feedback on their input, guiding them through the form-filling process.
